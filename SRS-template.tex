   \section{Introduction}
   	\subsection{Purpose}
		\paragraph{Application for splitting a restaurant bill between friends.}
		The application will be used as a utility in a social context to decrease the time it takes to work out how much everyone needs to contribute to a shared bill. 
		
   	\subsection{Scope}	
   	This project will essentially be divided into two phases, the first of which focuses heavily on user experience and the second accuracy.
		\paragraph{Phase One:}
		A multi-platform mobile application that users can send a photo of a bill to and receive an interactive interface generated from the data contained within that photo that they can then use to work out correct totals.
		\paragraph{Phase Two:}
		An artificial intelligence agent that has been trained to recognise text in a photo in a very specific way will be the backend mechanism that can be given any photo and will return a JSON object with the structure of that photo that can be parsed to create the interface in phase one. 
		
   	\subsection{Overview}
The goal of this document is to define a clear project scope that will be used to contain and guide coming deliverables as well as give clarity as to how our application will function as a system built up out of well-defined components.
